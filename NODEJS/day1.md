# Day 1  

## Some commands we learned in class today
1. ls (lists all files and folders)
2. mkdir test{1..5} (creates folder named test1 to test5)
3. mkdir test{test1, test2, test3} (creates 3 folders)
4. rm -ri test (it will ask if we want to remove the file/folder)

## Topics discussed today
-- Learned about Unix, Linux and windows  
-- Diff b/w kernel(system side) and shell(user side) -> interpreter for kernel  
-- why async await is used when doing asynchronous tasks
