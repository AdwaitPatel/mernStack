# GitHub
- git clone repoLink (clones the repo to your  system)
- git push origin main (pushes the code to main branch)

## git checkout branchName (it will implicitly fetch and pull the changes from main branch)

## Note : generally we don't have permission to checkout between branches what if we have only one then use SWITCH to change branches

- git fetch origin branch Name (it'll merge the changes from branchName to current one)
- git pull origin branchName (this'll get the changes to the local system)
- git pull will do both fetch and pull so don't need to use fetch in the latest git

## Pull Request

- A Pull Request is a request made by a developer to merge changes from one branch into another (usually from a feature branch into the main or develop branch).
- While a PR add info about the changes you've done and must see the file changes before merging.

## Resolving Conflicts on GitHub
- while merging a PR a conflict may arise and you have three options :-  
1) accept incoming changes
2) accept current changes
3) accept both changes
- just click on any and mark as resolve then merge
